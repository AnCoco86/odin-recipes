        <p>This is another summer staple. Very easy to prepare, wonderfully unpretentious, and very forgiving and delicious cook proccess</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A whole chicken, preferably from a butcher; alternatively, legs, thighs, and breasts</li>
            <li>smoked paprika</li>
            <li>the zest of one lemon</li>
            <li>kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Basting:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 stick high quality butter; unsalted</li>
            <li>2-3 garlic cloves; crushed</li>
            <li>fresh herbs; basil, sage, rosemary etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Break chicken down into parts; seperate thighs and legs; layout on a sheetpan, or large bowl</li>
            <li>season liberally with salt; then coat generously with smoked paprika; zest 1 lemon overtop</li>
            <li>move pieces into a large ziplock bag, 30 minutes (or overnight) before grilling</li>
            <li>next, prepare your basting butter; melt the butter gently in a small sauce pot.</li>
            <li>as the butter is melting, crush 2-3 cloves of garlic into it;</li>
            <li>let sit until the bubbles have settled; toss herbs in whole, and remove fat from heat</li>
            <li>Set your grill up to have a hot and medium side;</li>
            <li>cook the chicken over high heat, turning frequently, once ever 1-2 minutes. The more the better</li>
            <li>baste the surface of the chicken before flipping; remove pieces when done (roughly
                8-10 minutes for thighs and legs, 12-14 minutes for breasts)</li>
        </ol>
