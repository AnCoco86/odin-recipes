        <p><h3>Spaghetti & Meatballs</h3></p>
        <p>This is a favorite dish of mine. Combines ground beef mixed with spices and aromatics, and seared. 
            The Fond and Fat are then used to sweat more aromatics in the form of garlic, and chili flakes.
        This becomes the base for a rich tomato sauce, which will be finished with whole leaves of basil. </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
